TO WORK ON :
-- adding noise during training
-- kernel from forum
3steps dilated convolution on wavenet
kernel size inside resnet blocks
encadrement learning_rate for 1st convolution // full model
dilated convolution model -> wavenet 3/4 layers
"""

"""
RUNNING :
try only for resnet different kernels of 1st convolution stride 2 8 16 
test best models on the real test set - LOST OF 16% ?? ~ silence class 
"""

"""
COMPLETED :
per class accuracy
first step RSB: smaller kernel 0.5ms
try only for resnet different kernels of 1st convolution 10 / 20 / 1 ms
full model in one go (dilated)
full model in one go (GRU) - more tests on 3 steps ?
step 3 on model 1
testing CNN - architecture ? spectrogram that works well for time series
